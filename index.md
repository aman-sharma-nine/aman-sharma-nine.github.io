  I am a data scientist working for an AI startup. For past couple of years I have been working in client facing roles to build and deploy machine learning models, which gives me a new perspective on business problems and challenges organisations are facing irrespective of their sizes. Most of these organizations are overoptimistic of their current data strategies.I am very grateful to be expereiencing this first hand. While there are pelethora of data science blogs and tutorials, most of them are extremely helpful, I founded that there was a lack of resources when it comes to applied data science topics. I understand that every business is different and so is their problems and solutions, I think a framework to approach some common data science problems can be used to streamline the process. 
I am going to post some interesting (& some boring) business problems and some potentials approaches to solve them using machine learning. We will discuss the full ML life cycle, from problem definition, problem structuring , data structuring, model building, evalation, deployment and model monitoring strategies.
